RCB3Interface 1.0 

This is a library for controlling the RCB3 board on the KHR-2HV,KHR1-HV, MANOI AT01 (and probably PF01) robots.
Please read the document RCB3Interface_manual.odt before trying to use the library.

The library is coded in C and can be used easily from C and C++.
I have included wrappers for VB.NET and C# too.

The file RCB3_Interface.H and RCB3_Interface.LIB are provided to compile your programs (C/C++)
The file RCB3_Interface.dll must be in the execution path when you run your program.

The version obviously runs only on Windows.
